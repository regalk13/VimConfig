# My Neovim & Vim config
<code><img width="10%" src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/neovimio/neovimio-ar21.svg"></code>

## About

Well I decided to leave visual studio code and start working in neovim, at first it was difficult for me to adapt and so many commands, then I realized that I was missing things to be able to work effectively. At that time I knew about the add-ons or plugs for vim and neovim, I could add several and then I began to see vim config from several people where I took things that interested me, in the end I was left with this, I hope you like it.

## Required components

### You need:
 - Vim or neovim;
 - A folderfor the plugs in ~/.config/nvim;
 - "you may have problems with the folders but it would only be to name them correctly";
 
### Plugs:
"I hope I don't miss any"
- [Crtpl-vim](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) (Files)
- [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) (Themes)
- [Nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) (Files)
- [Coc-vim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) (Auto Completed)
- [Discord_nvim](https://github.com/aurieh/discord.nvim) (Discord rich precense)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) (Files)

## Final Clarifications

- Clearly all this code is not mine, just combine things and add the ones that I thought were essential.
- If you need to ask something my twitter is open and my discord.
- I wanted to add the configuration of "coc-vim" since it can give some problems without it.
